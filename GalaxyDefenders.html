              Your planet is under attack by aliens! Place your defenders and
              eliminate the aliens before they can take over. Galaxy Defenders
              is 2-D tower defense game that encourages the player to make
              strategic decisions.

            >Wanting to take my web development skills to the next level, I
            decided to learn JavaScript in-depth. I felt that a strong
            understanding of javascript was essential for developing any
            website, so I started creating Galaxy Defenders through an online
            JavaScript game tutorial by
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxYg8-mhhhs&t=603s"
              >Franks Laboratory</a
            >
            on YouTube. Like any programming tutorial that I follow, I take the
            fundamental part of the project, learn from it, then start making
            the code and project my own. So, the beginning of what I will be
            discussing on this page is what I learned from the tutorial, but I
            refined and organized the code later on to help myself expand and
            build the video game as my own.
          </p>
          <h3>The Basics</h3>
          <p>
            Shown below is the fundamentals of Galaxy Defenders. Before I can
            incorporate graphics and animations, I have to create boxes that act
            as different objects in the game. The goal of the game is to prevent
            the red enemy from reaching the left side of the screen. If you
            click on the left side of the screen, you will place a blue defender
            that will automatically start shooting bullets to lower the health
            of the red enemies. Every blue defender placed costs 100 resources,
            so place them carefully! You can hover your cursor over the yellow
            boxes to add more to your resources amount. Go ahead and play around
            and see if you can beat it!
          </p>

          <!--Beta 1-->
          <canvas id="canvas1"></canvas>
          <script src="towerdefense/scriptBeta1.js"></script>
          <p>
            Refresh your page if it says "game over" or "level complete" to play
            again
          </p>

          <!--The Basics-->
          <h3>Adding Animations</h3>
          <p>
            Much easier said than done, I add animations to the defenders and
            enemies. Although it is difficult to implement in the JavaScript
            code, the concept is surprisingly simple. Take a look at this
            picture of the Enemy Crawler.
            <span class="image left"
              ><img src="towerdefense/sprites/crawlEnemy.png" alt="" /></span
            >This is the same image used in my JavaScript code to animate its
            movement. I section off each part of the image to make 5 frames that
            the code rotates through as the enemy moves. The rotation can be
            sped up or slowed down when its speed changes. Every character and
            object in this game use that same concept with its own respective
            frames to animate movement. A complicated character like a defender
            has nearly 20 frames and only certain frames play during specific
            actions. Play the more animated version below and see what changed!
          </p>

          <canvas id="canvas2"></canvas>
          <script src="towerdefense/scriptBeta2.js"></script>
          <p>
            Refresh your page if it says "game over" or "level complete" to play
            again
          </p>

          <!--The Latest Version-->
          <h3>The Latest Version</h3>
          <p>
            The latest version of Galaxy Defenders,
            <a href="towerdefense/game.html" target="_blank">Alpha 1.1</a>, is a
            version that is much more reflective of what I have in mind for the
            final version of the game. Of course, I do not believe this to be
            even close to the final product, but it gives a solid demonstration
            of what the first level might look like.
            <a href="towerdefense/game.html" target="_blank">Alpha 1.1</a> has a
            menu system, full-color background, animated objects, and several
            types of enemies, including some that shoot the defenders. Click the
            button below to try it out!

          <h3>Closing Comments</h3>
          <p>
            This project has pushed me to think creatively as a programmer. I
            have learned a significant amount about JavaScript, and so much so
            that I would consider JavaScript as my strongest and most
            comfortable programming language. I had to apply many concepts that
            I learned from my Data Structures and Design course to make my code
            efficiently and effectively run. It also made me think about the
            long-term of my code and implementing designs that would be
            beneficial when changes are implemented in the future. Although I am
            proud of the current version, I hope to make a completed game. This
            final game will make the enemies unique, implement bosses, have
            either levels or an endless mode, have a store to buy powerups with,
            play fun music and sounds effects to back the gameplay, and have a
            high score board to compare players' scores.
