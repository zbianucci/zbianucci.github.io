          <!--<h3>Inspiration & Foundation</h3>-->
          <!--particle game pic 1-->
          <!-- <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/GamePlay1.PNG" alt="" /></span>This game was one of the last lab assignments of my Fundamentals of Computer Science that I took the first semester of my Freshmen year. During this class, I made the transition of majoring in Mathematics to majoring in Computer Science: Cyber Security, and I have not looked back since. Prior to that class, I had no experience with object-oriented languages such as Java, and I am impressed with how far I have come. The Tic-Tac-Toe game was the first project I made that felt that it had real content and purpose behind it. My other projects/labs prior to this would make small computations, have little interaction with the user, or was created for learning a specific topic.</p>

                <h3>The Basics</h3>
                <p>The game, as you can see, is visually displayed via the output terminal of an IDE,<span class="image left"><img src="images/GamePlay2.PNG" alt="" /></span> so the the grid and gameplay of the game is constructed through characters and symbols rather than drawn shapes. Data that is received by the players is imputted in a 3x3 array that will be translated to the visual grid. At the time I had not learned about try/catch statements, which would have benefitted this program tremendously. When I turned in this project, it did not have try/catch statements and would allow users to input characters that were not integers, which would result in crashing the program. However, as of writing this article, I have updated the code with appropriate try/catch statements.</p>
                           

                <h3>Difficulty Choices</h3>
                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Difficulty.PNG" alt="" /></span>Particle contains three
                    difficulty options to choose from to make the game enjoyable for all players.
                    I designed the Normal difficulty first because at the time I did not have intention for more
                    difficulties. Normal difficulty has the player start with a speed of 5 pixels per frame, allows
                    access to the shop, and moderately spawns enemies. The tutorial I followed showed how to make a
                    Hard difficulty, but I made many
                    modifications to its suggestions. The Hard difficulty has the player move 7 pixels per frame, does
                    not allow access to the shop, doubles the amount of initial health, and has greater spawn rate of
                    more difficult enemies. In the easy difficulty, there is access to the shop, the normal amount of
                    health, and a low spawn rate of enemies. </p>

                <h3>Color Menu</h3>
                <p>One of the most challenging
                    aspects that I purely created on my own was the color menu of the game.
                    The color menu allows the player to choose from a variety of colors to change the color of their
                    player to what ever they may like.<span class="image left"><img src="images/ColorMenu.PNG"
                            alt="" /></span> There are standard color options such as blue and pink, but the
                    color menu includes some interesting and fun choices to make gameplay visually exciting. The random
                    selection will generate a random color from over 16 million different colors, the rwb and ogp
                    options generate a stream of alternating through the three respective colors, the sparkle color goes
                    randomly through a stream of the 16 million colors, and the invisible option is simply colored black
                    to challenge the player matching the bacground (I can attest that it is possible to beat the game
                    invisible in easy mode). I am proud of the visual of the menu itself as the player in the back
                    matches the color of the selected option, which can be fun to play with in itself.</p>
