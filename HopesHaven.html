            My friend, founder and CEO of Hope's Haven,
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://hopeshaventn.com/ourTeam.html#:~:text=abbey%40hopeshaventn.com-,Abbey%20Sutherland,-Abbey%20Sutherland%20is"
              >Abbey Sutherland</a

            asked me to create a website for her non-profit. Hope's Haven is a
            Christ-centered summer camp for children with special needs and
            disabilities. They provide an environment for campers to grow in
            Christ, in relationships, and in confidence. At this moment, the
            camp is not yet built, but Hope's Haven is running events for its
            campers to enjoy, and there are plenty of fundraising events to help
            raise money for the future of the camp. This, of course, is a
            massive goal, which I partake in a small but vital role as the web
            designer. I have designed Hope's Haven's website in a way that
            engages interaction from the public, gives volunteers ways to
            support our non-profit, and provides information to the parents of
            campers. It is important that I create a fun, informative, and
            professional website that best reflects the message of Hope's Haven
            and provides accurate design changes as requested by Abbey. I love
            Hope's Haven's mission and hope to continue being part of the team
            for years to come.
          </p>
          <h3>A mobile website</h3>
          <p>
            <span class="image right"
              ><iframe
                src="https://hopeshaventn.com"
                title="Hope's Haven mobile phone demonstration"
                width="375"
                height="667"
              ></iframe
            ></span>
            To best make Hope's Haven accessible to hundreds of people, I have
            to make sure that it is effective on a mobile browser. Most of our
            sponsors, donors, supporters, and friends find out about Hope's
            Haven and its mission through social media, and from either our
            Facebook or Instagram page, they navigate to our website on what's
            likely a mobile browser. So, I need to make sure that their mobile
            experience on the website is just as good, if not better, than that
            on a browser. On the right, you can see a demonstration of the
            mobile browser. The navigation bar is hidden in the three line
            button (commonly known as a hamburger). This expands a menu when
            tapped and makes it more mobile friendly than trying to cram the
            navigation menu into a small window. Another major thing is making
            each element in a row on the website stack on top of each other, so
            the user can just scroll down to see each part. I have seen websites
            that do not do this and it makes the text and features really small
            and hard to read and forces the user to zoom in. Even highly
            professional sites are like this, but I do not think that something
            like this is acceptable for a website in this day and age.
          </p>
          <h3>Search results</h3>
          <p>
            Another large part and commonly overlooked aspect of web design is
            search results, more specifically, Google search results. A normal
            person would think that if you were to name your website after your
            organization and everything in your website discussed and mentioned
            something concerning your organization, Google would automatically
            bring your website up as a top search result, but that is simply not
            true. Other than paying to be an advertisement on Google (which
            Hope's Haven does not do), there are some tricks to make your
            website appear as some of the first few search results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Take a look at the following code snippet located in the HTML
            header:
            <br />
            <code>
              <!-- method(); -->
              &lt;link href="https://hopeshaventn.com"
              rel="canonical"/&gt;</code
            ><br />
            This tells Google what the canonical page is for the website. The
            canonical page is the main/first page of the website and encourages
            Google to use this page as one of its search results relating to the
            website.
          </p>
          <p>Also located in the HTML header is the website description:</p>

          <pre><code>&lt;meta name="description" content="Located in Chattanooga, TN,
              Hope's Haven is a non-profit Christ-centered summer camp for
              children with special needs and disabilities." /&gt;</code></pre>
          <p>
            This description tells google what to show as the search result:
            <br />
            <img
              src="images/googleSearch.PNG"
              height="90%"
              width="90%"
              style="border: solid gray"
            /><br />
            This search result also shows the different pages on the site: About
            Us, Campers, Get Involved, and Hope's Story.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another way to enhance search results is adding descriptors to the
            alt element of an image:
          </p>

          <pre><code>&lt;img
src="images/kids/partyKid.jpeg"
alt="Hope's Haven Special Needs Summer Camp: camper dancing to music"
style="padding: 15px"
/&gt;</code></pre>
          <p>
            By adding descriptors to images, Google uses these for Google Images
            search results and is more likely to improve your website's search
            result location for searches that contain similar words to your
            descriptor.
          </p>
          <h3>Closing Comments</h3>
          <p>
            I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to support such an
            amazing non-profit through my talents. Building Hope's Haven's
            website has helped me understand how to work for a client and listen
            to their requests. I, also, learned a great deal about designing a
            website with end-users in mind. Making something more engaging and
            user-friendly will help bring more traffic to the website. I am
            excited to see how my web development skills develop over the years
            through Hope's Haven!
