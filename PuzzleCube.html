            <p>
              A Python program that simulates the functionality of a standard
              3x3 puzzle cube. The program will eventually work to find optimal
              solutions to any puzzle cube scramble. As of right now, it can
              randomly mix a cube.
            </p>

          <h3>Inspiration & Foundation</h3>
          <p>
            Solving puzzle cubes has been my hobby for the longest time, so I
            thought I would take that experience and merge it with my love for
            programming. I wanted to start this project completely clean without
            any walkthroughs or tutorials: just my pure knowledge and any
            research about the functionality and statistics of the cube that I
            could find. I also wanted a project that was more back-end heavy. I
            want to push my abilities of Data Structures and object-oriented
            design in Python: a language I have become quite fond of.
          </p>

          <!--The Basics-->
          <h3>The Basics</h3>
          <p>
            Puzzle cubes are extremely complicated, and it will take an
            extremely long time to explain the complexities of it for this
            project, so I will explain things simply, not everything will make
            sense, but bear with me. Because this project is purely back-end,
            anyone without programming knowledge will be completely lost.

            <span class="image left"
              ><img src="images/rubik-flat.png" alt="" /></span
            >Take a look at the flattened image of the cube. This is the best
            way to represent a 3-D cube in 2-D. The program corresponds colors
            with integers to make the writing process faster. 0 is white, 1 is
            orange, 2 is green, 3 is red, 4 is blue, and 5 is green. The cube
            can be moved by turning one of the 6 faces clockwise,
            counterclockwise or a 180 degree turn (direction does not matter).
            Those moves are represented by the letters on the image. A single
            clockwise turn of the green face is considered F. A counterclockwise
            turn of the green face is considered F', which is pronounced "F
            prime." A 180 degree turn in either direction of the green face is
            F2. This terminology works for any of the faces with their
            corresponding letters and is the standard way to define moves for
            all competitive cube solvers.
          </p>

          <!--Stage 1-->
          <h3>Stage 1</h3>
          <p>
            I am building this program in stages, since I am not sure when/if I
            will ever make the end result. Stage one is to make a functioning
            cube that can be scrambled. With the terminology explained before in
            mind, you can see the output of the program below illustrate the
            image of the cube via the __str__ method. Below that I printed out
            twenty random moves of the cube to scramble it using the Scramble
            Class. If a person were to take a standard 3x3 solved puzzle cube
            and move the corresponding moves (assuming they hold it in the
            correct orientation with white on top and green facing the person),
            the physical cube will look exactly the same as the cube in the
            program.
