              A fast-paced arcade-style game that challenges the player's
              ability to react quickly to avoid enemies. Including Easy, Normal,
              and Hard difficulties, Particle is designed for players of all
              abilities.

          <h3>Inspiration & Foundation</h3>
          <!--particle game pic 1-->

            <span class="image right"
              ><img src="images/Gameplay1GIF.gif" alt="" /></span
            >After finishing my Freshman year Data Structures and Program Design
            class midst the Coronavirus epidemic, I was inspired to challenge my
            capabilities by creating a fully functioning Java game. At this
            point the "games" I have created only used the output window of the
            IDE because my classes never required anything like a JFrame or
            frame rates. I fully depended on RealTutsGML's series "Let's Build a
            Game in Java" to provide me with a basis for a game idea and the
            fundamentals of game design. I took his concept game originally
            called "Wave" and expanded upon it. The original Wave game in the
            tutorial, which is completely included in my game, includes a menu
            system, player control via key input, a few basic enemies, a red
            boss enemy, and many other concepts and ideas.
          </p>

          <!--The Basics-->
          <h3>The Basics</h3>
          <p>
            The player is a default white square that must dodge oncoming square
            enemies and bosses to avoid losing health. The player, enemies, and
            bosses have "trails" that make the experience visually attractive
            but do not have effect on actual gameplay or hitboxes. In normal and
            easy mode, the player can utilize a shop were they spend money
            (earned by staying on the screen over time) for health upgrades,
            speed upgrades, and health refills. The player
            <span class="image left"
              ><img src="images/Gameplay2GIF.gif" alt="" /></span
            >loses the game when their health bar is empty, and they win by
            surviving past all of the enemies, resulting in a congratulations
            visual. The concept of creating this gameplay initially blew my mind
            but after following the YouTube tutorial, I understand its
            simplicity. The game algorithm updates the screen of the game 60
            frames per second (FPS). The fillRect() method of the Graphics class
            in Java simply draws a solid rectangle with a designated size at a
            desired location. The rectangle appears to move because my code will
            draw the same rectangle 5 pixels in the corresponding direction the
            player inputs. 5 pixels is a small distance, but since the game runs
            60 FPS, the player moves 300 pixels a second or about half the
            screen--making the game fast paced. All of the enemies and bosses
            follow this concept but follow directions within the code or as
            reactions to the player's position.
          </p>

          <!--Difficulties-->
          <h3>Difficulty Choices</h3>
          <p>
            <span class="image right"
              ><img src="images/Gameplay3GIF.gif" alt="" /></span
            >Particle contains three difficulty options to choose from to make
            the game enjoyable for all players. I designed the Normal difficulty
            first because at the time I did not have intention for more
            difficulties. Normal difficulty has the player start with a speed of
            5 pixels per frame, allows access to the shop, and moderately spawns
            enemies. The tutorial I followed showed how to make a Hard
            difficulty, but I made many modifications to its suggestions. The
            Hard difficulty has the player move 7 pixels per frame, does not
            allow access to the shop, doubles the amount of initial health, and
            has greater spawn rate of more difficult enemies. In the easy
            difficulty, there is access to the shop, the normal amount of
            health, and a low spawn rate of enemies.
          </p>

          <!--ColorMenu-->
          <h3>Color Menu</h3>
          <p>
            One of the most challenging aspects that I purely created on my own
            was the color menu of the game. The color menu allows the player to
            choose from a variety of colors to change the color of their player
            to what ever they may like.<span class="image left"
              ><img src="images/ColorMenuGIF.gif" alt=""
            /></span>
            There are standard color options such as blue and pink, but the
            color menu includes some interesting and fun choices to make
            gameplay visually exciting. The random selection will generate a
            random color from over 16 million different colors, the rwb and ogp
            options generate a stream of alternating through the three
            respective colors, the sparkle color goes randomly through a stream
            of the 16 million colors, and the invisible option is simply colored
            black to challenge the player matching the background (I can attest
            that it is possible to beat the game invisible in easy mode). I am
            proud of the visual of the menu itself as the player in the back
            matches the color of the selected option, which can be fun to play
            with.

          <h3>Closing Comments</h3>
          <p>
            Particle is completely free to play, so please use the download link
            to try out the game for yourself! The download link will download a
            JAR file which requires you to have the current version of Java
            installed on your computer. Please note that I have had issues with
            the JAR file running on Apple computers. Windows 10 will show a
            warning about harming your computer, but I promise you it will not
            harm your computer whatsoever (It only shows that warning because it
            does not recognize my signature). I have also implement an online
            version of the game, but due to Google Chrome's security
            restrictions and dropped support of applets, I could only get the
            game to run via Repl.it. This is the only safe and free way I was
            able to implement my game to my website. Unfortunately, this online
            JDE is extremely slow and laggy, so the gameplay experience is
            nowhere near ideal. Sorry for the inconvenience, but it is the best
            I can do so far. I would love to hear from you and your experience,
            so I encourage to contact me via my social links and email provided.
            Please know that Particle or Bianucci Games is not trademarked in
            any way and does not have any intentional copyright infringement,
            that being said, please contact me via email to resolve any issues,
            and I will be quick to make appropriate changes. Particle was made
            to allow myself to expand my programming knowledge, and educate and
            entertain those that play the game.
