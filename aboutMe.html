            >I graduated from Cleveland High School in Cleveland, TN, where I
            developed my interest in engineering, science, and mathematics. My
            first interaction with basic programming was in my Engineering
            Applications class where I learned basic ladder logic on a Siemens
            PLC trainer that controlled an assembly line. Besides a small
            exposure to a beginner robotics language, I did not have much
            experience with applicable Computer Science languages. Since my
            transition from majoring in Mathematics to Computer Science: Cyber
            Security during my first freshman semester at the University of
            Tennessee at Chattanooga, I have developed a strong use and
            understanding of Java, Python, and object-oriented programming
            through my college courses. I exposed myself to HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript while creating this website, and have taken informal
            online courses in those languages to enhance my knowledge. I am
            currently a junior at UTC and cannot wait to see where opportunities
            might take me.
          </p>
          <h3>Hobbies and Involvement</h3>

              ><img src="images/Swimming.jpg" alt=""
            /></span>
            If you know me at all, you will know that I'm constantly swimming
            and riding my road bike. And to no surprise, I am the vice president
            of the UTC swim club and a member of the UTC cycling club, which is
            how I spend most of my time at UTC. I am a member of two Honor
            Societies at UTC: Alpha Lambda Delta and Phi Eta Sigma. I, also,
            train with UTC's Cyber Defense Team: MocSec. We practice both
            offensive and defensive cybersecurity, and I hope to compete in my
            first competition soon.

          <h3>Work Experience</h3>
          <p>
            In highschool, summer 2017 and 2018 I worked as a lifeguard and
            assistant manager of three pools in the Cleveland City area. This
            job developed my social and problem solving skills, and it taught me
            how to make calm and swift decisions while under pressure. Summer
            2020 I worked as a Cabin Counselor at Camp Lakewood in Potosi,
            Missouri. Being responsible for children every day and night
            definitlely taught me patience, kindness, and enthusiasm, even when
            I was drained of energy. Around August 2020, my friend Abbey
            Sutherland, who is the CEO and Founder of Hope's Haven asked me to
            create a website for her wonderful non-profit. Developing that
            website challenged me as a programmer and sprung up a passion as a
            website and software developer. In December 2020 - April 2021, I
            participated in paid Cyber Security Research at UTC under the
            direction of Dr. Mengjun Xie. I developed a back-end Python program
            that automatically scheduled tasks as directed by the user. This
            opportunity helped me experience working on a full software
            development team, enhance my knowledge in Python and SQL, and
            further understand operating on a Linux system. From May to August
            2021, I had my first experience in industry as an IT intern for
            Plastic Omnium. Plastic Omnium is a multi-billion dollar
            coorporation that manufactures bumpers and tailgates for car
            manufacturers such as VolksWagen. As the IT intern, I directly
            assisted the head IT Engineer in the Chattanooga Plant. I provided
            on-site IT solutions to the site's office and plant floor, and I
            remotely supported the full IT team located around the United
            States. All of these amazing opportunities have development me both
            as a person and a professional, and I cannot wait for what is in
            store for me ahead.
